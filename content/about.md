I've interned at Yelp, Deloitte, and CIBC analyzing data and training machine learning models. Click on my [resume](/JaredArcilla.pdf) to find out more about my experiences on these fantastic teams.

Here, I plan to write about anything and everything. From my emacs workflow to movies I've watched.
