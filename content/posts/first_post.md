## Why a blog? {#why-a-blog}

Ever since I dove into emacs for the first time, I've been filling my laptop up with pages and pages of journals, notes and reviews.

A lot of my journalling is very private, consisting of intimate thoughts that I just needed to get down on paper. For a small subset of my writings, however, like reviews, how-to's, reflections, some of it I do want to share.

Also here I'm able to use \\(\LaTeX\\) - something that I've always wanted on Twitter.


## Who is this meant for? {#who-is-this-meant-for}

A lot of my content won't be made for an audience in mind, but rather made for that rare moment when someone asks:

> Why are you using Emacs?
>
> What did you think about X movie or Y album?

Then I can dump a whole blog post in their DM's rather than retype my thoughts.

In the future, when I've gotten the hang of things, I do want to start posting about mental health and philosophy. In my darkest times, I scoured the internet trying to find someone who understood what I was going through. I hope I can be that person for someone else.
