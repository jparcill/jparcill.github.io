This is just a peek into my ordinary life. My name is Jared Arcilla.


I've interned at Yelp, Deloitte, and CIBC analyzing data and training machine learning models. Click on my [[file:~/projects/personal/static/JaredArcilla.pdf][resume]] to find out more about my experiences on these fantastic teams.

Here, I plan to write about anything and everything. From my emacs workflow to movies I've watched.

The picture above is an AI generated dog! This project creates low resolution dog image generator using Pytorch and DCGAN techniques. This happens to be one of my favourite projects so far, letting me dip a toe into the world of AI art.
** Sentiment Analysis for IMDB Reviews
/See it [[https://github.com/jparcill/imdb_review_sentiment/blob/master/LSTM%20implementation.ipynb][here]]/

Model for predicting the sentiment of a movie review. This project allowed me to learn and implement word embeddings, and LSTM layers to understand how the user was feeling about a movie.
** Pokemon Winner Predictor

[[file:~/projects/personal/static/img/Pokemon.jpg]]

Trained a Random Forest Classifier to predict the outcome of a Pokemon battle. I applied feature engineering to produce a column that estimated type advantages betwen two Pokemon, raising the accuracy by 10%
